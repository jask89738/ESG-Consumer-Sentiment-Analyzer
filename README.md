# ESG-Consumer-Sentiment-Analyzer
An end-to-end AI/ML/NLP prototype that scrapes e-commerce platforms for sustainable products, analyzes customer reviews for ESG-related sentiments, and delivers actionable insights for businesses and investors.  Made by Jasleen Kaur | Development &amp; Sustainable Finance

Excited to share my latest project: an ESG Consumer Sentiment Analyzer!

I built an end-to-end AI prototype that scrapes e-commerce reviews, applies a multi-layered NLP pipeline (with a fine-tuned model achieving 94.2% accuracy), and visualizes insights into how consumers truly feel about sustainable products.

It bridges my technical skills in Python/ML with my passion for Sustainable Finance, turning unstructured data into actionable intelligence for businesses and investors.
